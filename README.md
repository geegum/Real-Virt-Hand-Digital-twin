# Real-Virt-Hand-Digital-twin
An immersive teleoperation system for high-risk tasks at KAERI (e.g., LLRW handling). Built in Unity/C++, it allows intuitive control of a Doosan A0509 robot using Meta Quest hand tracking. The operator is immersed in a real-time 3D digital twin of the site, generated from Azure Kinect data, ensuring safe remote manipulation.
